SimpleChat
==========

A very basic & simple web chat based on Mojolicious (backend) and Twitter Boostrap & jQuery (frontend).
Uses WebSockets and basic sessions for auto-generated users.

Its configurable via a JSON configuraion file (<b>ChatIt.conf.json</b>).

## Notes:
Its not, by all means, supposed to be used in production environment. its just me playing around with WebSockets
and <b>Mojolicious::Lite</b>.
